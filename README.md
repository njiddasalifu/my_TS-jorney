# Typescript
This repo is a host to my TS codes as i am on the go learning. Feel free to clone the codes, change and use them any where you deem then useful.
# Running the codes
Here, we need to have typescript compiler installed in our system before we can execute each file.
We use the conmmand `tsc filename.ts` and check out the results on the console.
